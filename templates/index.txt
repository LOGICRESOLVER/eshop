<h3>About Nootropics</h3>
<br>
Nootropics (/noʊ.əˈtroʊpɪks/ noh-ə-TROHP-iks or /noʊ.əˈtrɒpɪks/ noh-ə-TROP-iks;[1] but not /njuːˈtroʊpɪks/ new-TROHP-iks or /njuːˈtrɒpɪks/ new-TROP-iks,[1] which are common mispronunciations), colloquially brain supplements, smart drugs and cognitive enhancers, are natural, semisynthetic or synthetic compounds which purportedly improve cognitive functions, such as executive functions, attention or memory.

While commonly in the form of dietary supplements, nutraceuticals or energy drinks,[2] some nootropic compounds are prescription and non-prescription drugs in various countries.

In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and FDA have warned manufacturers and consumers about possible advertising fraud and marketing scams concerning nootropic supplements.[3][4]
