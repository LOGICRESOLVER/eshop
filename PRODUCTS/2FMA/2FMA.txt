2-Fluoromethamphetamine (also known as 2-FMA) is a novel stimulant substance of the amphetamine class. It is a structural analog of methamphetamine and is related to 2-FA, 3-FA, and 4-FMA. 2-FMA produces its stimulant effects through action at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors in the brain.

The sale of 2-FMA on the online research chemical market was first reported in August 2007.[1]. It appeared alongside other fluorinated amphetamines like 2-FA and 4-FA. It appears to be unknown in the clinical and research literature.

Subjective effects include stimulation, focus enhancement, motivation enhancement, increased libido, appetite suppression, and euphoria. It is commonly taken either orally or via insufflation and is reported to be highly unpleasant and dangerous to vaporize as the heat can break off the carbon-fluoride bond which in turn can be very toxic. 2-FMA is commonly compared to lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) in its duration, potency and efficacy as a study or productivity aid. A substantial increase in adverse effects like high blood pressure and increased heart rate are often reported for dosages above the heavy dosage range.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2-FMA. It is strongly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.
