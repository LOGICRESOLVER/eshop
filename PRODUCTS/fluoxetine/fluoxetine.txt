Fluoxetine, sold under the brand name Prozac, among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class.[2] It is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.[2] It is also approved for treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and children 8 years of age and over.[11] It has also been used to treat premature ejaculation.[2] Fluoxetine is taken by mouth.[2]

Common side effects include indigestion, trouble sleeping, sexual dysfunction, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth, and rash. Serious side effects include serotonin syndrome, mania, seizures, an increased risk of suicidal behavior in people under 25 years old, and an increased risk of bleeding.[2] Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is less likely to occur with fluoxetine than with other antidepressants, but it still happens in many cases. Fluoxetine taken during pregnancy is associated with significant increase in congenital heart defects in the newborns.[12][13] It has been suggested that fluoxetine therapy may be continued during breastfeeding if it was used during pregnancy or if other antidepressants were ineffective.[14]

Fluoxetine was invented by Eli Lilly and Company in 1972, and entered medical use in 1986.[15] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[16] It is available as a generic medication.[2] In 2021, it was the 25th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 22 million prescriptions.[17][18] Lilly also markets fluoxetine in a fixed-dose combination with olanzapine as olanzapine/fluoxetine (Symbyax).[19][20]
