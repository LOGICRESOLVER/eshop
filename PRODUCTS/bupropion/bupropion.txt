Bupropion, formerly called amfebutamone,[16] and sold under the brand name Wellbutrin among others, is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support smoking cessation.[17][18] It is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of "incomplete response" to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.[18][19] Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction,[18] it is not associated with weight gain[18] and sleepiness,[20] and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue.[21] Bupropion, particularly the immediate release formulation, carries a higher risk of seizure than many other antidepressants, hence caution is recommended in patients with a history of seizure disorder.[22]

Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating.[23][failed verification] Raised blood pressure is notable.[24] Rare but serious side effects include seizures,[23] liver toxicity,[25] psychosis,[26] and risk of overdose.[27] Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased odds of congenital heart defects.[28]

Bupropion acts as a norepinephrineâ€“dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and a nicotinic receptor antagonist.[15] However, its effects on dopamine are weak and clinical significance is contentious.[29][30][31][32][33] Chemically, bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and more generally that of substituted amphetamines and substituted phenethylamines.[1][34]

Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta, who worked at Burroughs Wellcome, in 1969.[35] It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1985.[36] Bupropion was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000.[16] In 2021, it was the eighteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 29 million prescriptions.[37][38] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[39]
