Moclobemide, sold under the brand names Amira, Aurorix,[8] Clobemix, Depnil and Manerix[9] among others, is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) drug primarily used to treat depression and social anxiety.[10][11][12] It is not approved for use in the United States,[13] but is approved in other Western countries such as Canada, the UK[12] and Australia.[14] It is produced by affiliates of the Hoffmannâ€“La Roche pharmaceutical company. Initially, Aurorix was also marketed by Roche in South Africa, but was withdrawn after its patent rights expired and Cipla Medpro's Depnil and Pharma Dynamic's Clorix became available at half the cost.

No significant rise in blood pressure occurs when moclobemide is combined with amines such as tyramine-containing foods or pressor amine drugs, unlike with the older irreversible and non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which cause a severe rise in blood pressure with such combination.[10] Due to the lack of anticholinergic, cardiovascular, cognitive and psychomotor impairments moclobemide is advantageous in the elderly as well as those with cardiovascular disease.[10]
