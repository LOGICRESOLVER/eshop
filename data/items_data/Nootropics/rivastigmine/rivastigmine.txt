Rivastigmine (sold under the trade name Exelon among others) is a cholinesterase inhibitor used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.[4] The drug can be administered orally or via a transdermal patch; the latter form reduces the prevalence of side effects,[5] which typically include nausea and vomiting.[6]

The drug is eliminated through the urine, and appears to have relatively few drug-drug interactions.[6]

It was patented in 1985 and came into medical use in 1997.[7]
