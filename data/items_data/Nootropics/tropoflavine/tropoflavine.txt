Tropoflavin, also known as 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, is a naturally occurring flavone found in Godmania aesculifolia, Tridax procumbens, and primula tree leaves.[2][3][4] It has been found to act as a potent and selective small-molecule agonist of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) (Kd ≈ 320 nM), the main signaling receptor of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).[5][6][7] Tropoflavin is both orally bioavailable and able to penetrate the blood–brain barrier.[8][9] A prodrug of tropoflavin with greatly improved potency and pharmacokinetics, R13 (and, formerly, R7), is under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[10][11]

Tropoflavin has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in animal models of a variety of central nervous system disorders,[7] including depression,[8] Alzheimer's disease,[12][13][14] cognitive deficits in schizophrenia,[15] Parkinson's disease,[5] Huntington's disease,[16] amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,[17] traumatic brain injury,[18] cerebral ischemia,[19][20] fragile X syndrome,[21] and Rett syndrome.[22] Tropoflavin also shows efficacy in animal models of age-associated cognitive impairment[23] and enhances memory consolidation and emotional learning in healthy rodents.[24][25] In addition, tropoflavin possesses powerful antioxidant activity independent of its actions on the TrkB receptor,[26] and protects against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity,[27] 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity,[28] and oxidative stress-induced genotoxicity.[29] It was also found to block methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, an effect which, in contrast to the preceding, was found to be TrkB-dependent.[30]

In 2017, evidence was published suggesting that tropoflavin and various other reported small-molecule TrkB agonists might not actually be direct agonists of the TrkB and might be mediating their observed effects by other means.[31][32]
