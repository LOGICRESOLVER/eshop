Venlafaxine, sold under the brand name Effexor among others, is an antidepressant medication of the serotoninâ€“norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class.[6][9] It is used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder.[9] Studies have shown that venlafaxine improves post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[10] It may also be used for chronic pain.[11] It is taken by mouth.[9] It is also available as the salt venlafaxine besylate in an extended-release formulation (Venbysi XR).[7]

Common side effects include loss of appetite, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, sweating, insomnia, drowsiness and sexual problems.[9] Severe side effects include an increased risk of suicide, mania, and serotonin syndrome.[9] Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome may occur if stopped.[9] There are concerns that use during the later part of pregnancy can harm the baby.[9] How it works is not entirely clear, but it seems to be related to the potentiation of the activity of some neurotransmitters in the brain.[9]

Venlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1993.[9] It is available as a generic medication.[9] In 2021, it was the 44th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 15 million prescriptions.[12][13]
